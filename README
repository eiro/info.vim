info.vim is a frontend for the info command. It requires vim 6.x and GNU info.
adds new command `Info': without arguments it displays "directory" node, with
single argument displays this file (eg `:Info libc'). with two arguments, first
specifies file and second node to display (eg `:Info libc POSIX\ Threads' --
note space escaping). within browser, press ,h key to see available key
shortcuts.

I already find it more confortable than the official info gui but this can be
improved so this is my attempt.

The original info navigator is here:

Its github mirror is here:
